Format based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/).

## [0.1.0-alpha.1] - 2026-06-16

### Added

- Generic template core with `project.fixture.ts` seam and `frameworkFixtureExtend`
- Reference Adapter under `example/erpku/` (POMs, auth setup, adapter env overlay)
- MCP adapter path seam (`PLAYWRIGHT_ADAPTER_*`) and Playwright profile bootstrap (#16/#19)
- `createFrameworkReporters()` for Healer JSON gate (#15)
- Alpha workshop docs: `docs/WORKSHOP.md`, `docs/ALPHA-LIMITATIONS.md`
- ADRs 0001–0003, `docs/FORK-ONBOARDING.md`, `CONTEXT.md`

### Changed

- ERPKU-specific code moved from template core to `example/erpku/`
- `playwright-test` MCP uses profile launcher (`scripts/playwright-test-mcp-launch.ts`)
- CI E2E artifact paths aligned with ERPKU adapter outputs
- `get_test_failures` prefers config-mapped JSON over stale `results.json`
- README Node requirement aligned to >= 22.22.1
- Workshop Path B documented as adapter reference only (no AI generate to adapter root)
- Generator verification sections renamed (CLI vs MCP) to avoid workshop Path A/B confusion

### Known limitations (alpha)
